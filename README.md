## Bulk issue creation

The `create_issues.sh` script executes every `gh issue` command listed in `Planner2ghlist.txt`. Ensure you have the GitHub CLI installed and authenticated, then run:

```bash
./create_issues.sh
```

A workflow named **Bulk issue creation** is also available for manual execution from the Actions tab.
